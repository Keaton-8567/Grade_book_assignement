Keaton Kuykendall's Excel Gradebook
1. Introduction

This Excel workbook provides a graphical interface to update and change students grades (students and grade of which are randomly generated)

This readme file provides a guide to using the workbook effectively.

2. Sheet Descriptions

There are two sheets in this workbook "Gradebook" and "Randomize"

The Gradebook worksheet:
    This is the actual interface of the Gradebook and allows you to change the values of the grades.
    Moving horizontal throughout the worksheet the user can see all 5 assignments and sub assignments that each "student" was assigned.
    Also the total grade is calculated and rounded to the appropriate grade letter (ex. 90-100 = A, 80-89 = B, grade <= 69 = F).

The Randsomize Worksheet:
    This worksheet holds all of the data that can be used to randomize the names and grades of the students. 

    This worksheet is not ment to be edited and editing this worksheet may cause the program to encounter errors

3. Using the Workbook

The Gradebook worksheet:
    Changing values can simply be changed by pressing the Randomize Values Macro Button.
    Another option is that the user can type any value and watch the rows update. 
    The user could also copy and paste the first column (column A) which has the same effect as the macro button. 

The Randsomize Worksheet:

4. Additional Notes

This workbook assumes you have a basic understanding of Excel functionalities. 
This is also a crude atempt to turn in something compared to my not well working application I tried to make.
The program I tried to make was a website whose frontend is programed in React.
The serverless backend is hosted by mongodb's Realm Service programed in NodeJS with it's backend being a mongodb noSQL database.

This the React project listed above I was almost able to finish however to get a grade I am turning in this backup idea instead.

If you are intrested here is the Github and website link.
